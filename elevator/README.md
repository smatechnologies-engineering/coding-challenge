# CoreElevator
- Run CoreElevator and you'll be presented with a GUI in the console. The commands window at the bottom let's you put in floor requests.
- Enter floors like "12" or "12U" etc. The pending requests will show in the upper left, and the status of the elevator is on the top right.
- Logs are kept in the root of the folder of the EXE.
